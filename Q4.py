# Write a function that takes in a non empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. 
# If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. 
# If no two numbers sum up to target sum, the function should return an empty array. 
# Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two diff integers in the array; you canâ€™t add a single integer 
# to itself in order to obtain the target sum.
# You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.
# Array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
# Targetsum = 10
# Sample output
# [-1,11]
